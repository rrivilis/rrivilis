# Canonical Physical Production Specification

**The Book of Recursions**
Specification Version: 1.0

---
## Purpose & Philosophy

This document specifies the binding, paper, print, and material requirements for the canonical physical realization of this work, along with subsequent requirements for accessible independent circulations according to material capacity. All constraints are functional and intentional. Substitutions or optimizations are not permitted unless explicitly stated.

**Design Principle:**  
The physical form of this work is constitutive of its meaning. A fixed or irreversible binding would be incompatible with its claims. The object is designed for recursion, re-entry, and parallel traversal through use.

---
## I. Format & Dimensions

- **Trim size:** 225 x 342 mm
- **Trim tolerance:** ±1.5 mm maximum
- **Scaling:** No resizing or auto-scaling permitted

---

## II. Binding System (Non-Negotiable)

### Core Requirements

- **Binding type:** Modular screw-post binding (Chicago screws / binding bolts)
- **Minimum posts:** 3 (4 preferred for stability)
- **Post length:** Must allow ≥15–20% expansion for added pages

### Binding Behavior

- Sections must be independently removable and re-insertable
- No adhesives permitted anywhere in the page stack
- No spine compression or permanent fastening

**This binding system is mandatory and integral to the work.**

---

## III. Section Architecture

The book is composed of discrete sections with intentional blank interleaving pages inserted between all sections. Blank pages are structurally significant and must match the primary paper stock.

### Affordances

- Sections may be reordered
- Sections may be removed for parallel reference
- Additional pages may be inserted by the reader

No single reading order is privileged or enforced.
### Interleaved Annotation Pages

A portion of interleaved pages shall be reserved for structured annotation. These pages shall consist of **4 mm grid paper**, including diagonal angle guides, intended for diagrammatic, geometric, and temporal notation.

Each structured interleave shall include a **blank writing block in the upper-left corner**, reserved for manual entry of **date and time** by the reader.

The remaining interleaved pages shall remain unruled and unmarked. The ratio of structured to unstructured interleaves may vary by print run, but structured interleaves shall remain a minority of total interleaves.

Each structured interleave shall also include a **small adjacent field** reserved for manual notation or sketching of the **lunar phase** at the time of reading or annotation. This field shall remain unmarked and unillustrated in print, serving solely as a reader-supplied calendric index notation.

---

## IV. Paper Specification (Mandatory)

- **Paper:** Tomoe River paper only
- **Scope:** All pages, including blank interleaves
- **Weight:** Range of **52–60 gsm** is permitted
- **Substitution:** Not permitted

**52 gsm** is preferred where feasible, as it balances maximum information density with acceptable durability under repeated handling. Heavier weights within the specified range may be used where structural considerations require.
### Required Properties

- Ultra-low caliper for modular expansion
- High tensile strength for repeated handling
- Fountain-pen-safe sizing
- Controlled translucency (ghosting acceptable)

---

## V. Grain Direction (Critical)

- **Grain direction:** Parallel to the binding edge

**This is non-negotiable.**

---

## VI. Punch / Drill Geometry

- **Hole diameter:** Compatible with standard Chicago screws (6 mm)
- **Edge distance:** Generous inner margin; punch zone treated as load-bearing
- **Alignment:** Holes must align precisely across all sections and covers
- **Reinforcement:** Margin width only (no grommets or eyelets)

---

## VII. Ink & Print Characteristics

- **Color mode:** CMYK optimized for text fidelity
- **Ink coverage:** Conservative; avoid heavy solids
- **Black:** Single-channel black preferred (no rich black)
- **Enhancements:** No auto-contrast, sharpening, or image optimization
- **Print method:** Offset or high-quality digital suitable for ultra-thin paper

---

## VIII. Registration & Imposition

- **Front–back registration:** Tight tolerance required
- **Imposition:** Consistent across all sections
- **Transparency consideration:** Misregistration must be minimized due to paper translucency

---

## IX. Margins & Inner Edge Allowance

- Inner (binding) margin must exceed typographic minimums
- Margin must tolerate repeated removal and reinsertion without deformation

---

## X. Edge Treatment

- **Cut:** Clean square cut preferred
- **Prohibited:** Gilding, dyeing, lamination, or edge coatings

---

## XI. Assembly & Handling

- Pages must remain uncollated until final screw-post assembly
- No adhesive binding processes permitted at any stage
- Pages must lie flat when posts are loosened

---

## XII. Quality Control Requirements

At minimum:

- One fully assembled section test
- One remove/reinsert stress test
- One annotation test page (pen + pencil)

---

## XIII. Explicit Prohibitions

- No perfect binding, saddle stitching, or sewn spines
- No paper substitution
- No ink enhancement or contrast "correction"
- No resizing, scaling, or layout adjustment
- No lamination or coating

---

## XIV. Hardware Specification

### Screw Posts (Mandatory)

- **Type:** Low-profile Chicago screws (binding bolts)
- **Material:** Steel
- **Finish:** PVD-coated (non-painted, non-anodized)
- **Diameter:** 6 mm
- **Threading:** Standard machine thread; replaceable with off-the-shelf components

### Assembly Capacity

- **Assembly load:** 75% of post capacity at initial binding
- **Expansion headroom:** Minimum 25% reserved for added pages

### Rationale

- Steel provides long-term structural integrity under repeated torque
- PVD finish resists abrasion, avoids flaking or oxidation, remains visually stable over decades
- Low-profile heads minimize snagging during handling
- 75% capacity prevents thread stress and allows future growth

**Posts must be individually replaceable without disassembling the full book.**

---

## XV. Cover Construction

### Front Cover

- **Material:** Metal sheet (stainless steel #4 brushed or equivalent)
- **Finish:** Durable, non-gloss surface (no lamination)
- **Function:** Structural protection and wear resistance
- **Thickness:**  **0.8–1.2 mm**, balancing rigidity, weight, and long-term handling durability. Minor variance within this range is acceptable provided the cover remains non-flexing under normal use.
### Back Cover

- **Material:** Wood veneer over stable substrate (Baltic birch plywood recommended)
- **Finish:** Sealed, non-flexing (water-based polyurethane or dewaxed shellac)
- **Function:** Tactile contrast and structural balance

### Requirements

- Covers must be drilled to align exactly with interior pages
- No adhesive lamination layers
- No coatings that crack or delaminate over time

### Rationale

- Metal front cover protects against shelf wear and handling damage
- Wood veneer provides dimensional stability, warmth without softness, and easy refinishing if damaged
- Asymmetry signals intentional object design, not decoration

## XVI. Front Cover Marking

### Text Content

```
the book of recursions
```

### Typographic Treatment

- **Orientation:** Rotated 90° clockwise, positioned diagonally toward bottom-right corner
- **Typeface:** Neutral grotesk (Helvetica, Akzidenz-Grotesk, Univers, or Arial)
- **Weight:** Regular (450–500) or Medium (500–550) only
- **Case:** Lowercase only
- **Character spacing:** Default (no tracking adjustment)
- **Size:** 8–12pt equivalent (legible from 18" in moderate light)

### Placement

- Located in lower-right quadrant with asymmetric offset from edges
- **Not centered** on any axis
- Recommended coordinates: **38–50 mm** from bottom edge, **38–50 mm** from right edge
- Diagonal angle: 5–15° off pure vertical axis

**Placement principle:** Should read as notation or calibration mark, not branding.

### Engraving Specification

- **Method:** Mechanical engraving or laser etching
- **Depth:** 0.1–0.15mm maximum
- **Profile:** Clean V-groove or flat-bottom channel
- **Surface:** Engrave after final finish; no polishing within letterforms

### Prohibited Treatments

- No ink, paint, or fill of any kind
- No contrast enhancement or darkening agents
- No protective coating over text (unless uniform across entire cover)

**Text visibility depends entirely on light angle, tactile inspection, and viewer proximity.**

### Quality Control

- Text fully legible in raking light
- No burrs or raised edges
- Uniform depth across all characters
- Placement consistent across all copies (±2mm tolerance)

### Conceptual Function

This marking operates as:

1. **Identifier** — minimal information for recognition
2. **Calibration mark** — suggests precision instrument rather than bound book
3. **Anti-title** — resists traditional title page hierarchy
4. **Temporal marker** — will age with cover, becoming more/less visible over decades

---

## XVII. Enclosure

### Slipcase

- **Type:** Rigid slipcase with archival construction
- **Material:** Binder's board (2–3mm, acid-free) covered with bookcloth (linen or cotton weave)
- **Interior lining:** Acid-free book-liner paper or thin cotton rag paper
- **Fit:** Snug but non-compressive
- **Clearance:** 3mm top/bottom, 2mm spine edge
- **Spine depth:** Current book thickness + 8–10mm (allows 25% expansion)

### Function

- Protects edges and hardware
- Stabilizes shelving
- Mitigates dust ingress

**No magnetic closures or elastic restraints.**

---

## XVIII. Compatibility & Maintenance

### Serviceability Requirements

All hardware must be:

- Commercially replaceable
- Serviceable with standard tools
- Non-proprietary

The object must tolerate without structural damage:

- Post replacement
- Section removal
- Partial disassembly

### Conservation & Longevity Principles

All materials selected for:

- Corrosion resistance
- Mechanical reversibility
- Low degradation over time

Binding and enclosure comply with institutional conservation standards favoring:

- Non-destructive repair
- Component replacement
- Long service life

---

## XIX. Additional Prohibitions

- No glued spines
- No adhesive-only fasteners
- No painted hardware
- No plastic covers
- No lamination films
- No soft-touch coatings

---

## XX. Aging Behavior

### Expected Changes Over Time

- Engraved text may collect fine dust/oils (acceptable)
- Metal patina may equalize contrast (acceptable)
- Text may become less visible (consistent with object's philosophy)
- Wood veneer may develop patina (acceptable)

**No maintenance required or recommended.**

If institutional owner wishes to restore legibility of engraved text:

- Light degreasing with isopropyl alcohol only
- No re-engraving
- No contrast enhancement

---
## XXI. Equatorium

The Equatorium includes a **single minimally tactile interactive element**. The **outer circular ring** is mounted as a hand-rotatable disc around a fixed inner diagram.

The outer ring rotates freely and continuously about a central pivot relative to the stationary interior geometry. Rotation is unindexed and without mechanical stops. No instructional markings are provided to indicate operation.

The interior geometry of the Equatorium intentionally extends beyond the outer circular ring. This overrun is integral to the diagram and shall not be clipped, masked, resized, or visually corrected during prepress, printing, or assembly. The outer ring is not a bounding frame and shall not be treated as a containment boundary for the interior geometry.

All components must retain their relative scale and alignment exactly as supplied.

# Acquisition Justification (For Library Use)

**Title:** _The Book of Recursions_  
**Format:** Physical volume (specified instrument-style binding)
### Scope and Significance

_The Book of Recursions_ is a research-level work situated at the intersection of natural philosophy, formal dissipative systems, and computability logic. It is intended for long-term reference, consultation, and rereading rather than linear or casual consumption. The work is designed to be entered non-sequentially and to support diagrammatic and marginal analysis by the reader.
### Format and Durability

The physical format is intentionally specified to support institutional longevity:

- Modular screw-post binding allows for repair, page replacement, and future expansion without rebinding.
- Materials (paper, hardware, covers, enclosure) are selected for predictable aging and non-catastrophic failure modes.
- No adhesive-only or irreversible binding methods are used.
- The volume is enclosed in a replaceable archival slipcase for shelf stability and protection.

The volume is constructed using non-adhesive, mechanically reversible binding and archival materials selected for predictable aging, repairability, and long-term institutional stewardship.

These choices significantly reduce long-term replacement and conservation costs relative to conventional perfect-bound or adhesive hardcover volumes.
### Use Value

The book functions as a reference instrument rather than a trade monograph. It supports:

- Nonlinear consultation
- Diagrammatic reasoning
- Long-term scholarly use
- Repeated handling without structural degradation

Structured interleaves allow readers to situate annotations temporally and diagrammatically, aligning with research and study practices rather than casual reading.
### Institutional Fit

This item is well suited to:

- Research libraries
- University libraries
- Special collections focused on philosophy, systems theory, or interdisciplinary scholarship

The object does not rely on market novelty, frequent new editions, or aesthetic trends. Its format is explicitly designed to remain stable and serviceable over decades.
### Cost Consideration

While the unit cost may exceed that of standard trade volumes, the total cost of ownership is expected to be lower due to:

- Reduced need for rebinding or replacement
- Repairability with standard tools and materials
- Long usable lifespan under normal circulation conditions

This work represents a durable, institutionally legible knowledge object designed for long-term stewardship. Its acquisition prioritizes preservation, serviceability, and scholarly utility over short-term circulation metrics.

# Note for Local Printers, Collectives, Distros, and Worker-Owned Presses

This text is intentionally licensed to support **local, collective, and worker-run reproduction**. You do not need permission to print, excerpt, or circulate it.

The work is realizable as shared text across multiple material forms. A canonical physical edition is specified for long-term institutional stewardship in libraries and archives. In parallel, the text is intentionally licensed to enable accessible editions produced by anarchist distributors, local print collectives, shop-floor presses, and worker-owned publishers according to their material capacities. These editions are not derivative or secondary in intellectual status; they differ only in physical realization and intended mode of circulation.
## What matters

- **Textual integrity.** Please do not rewrite, abridge, or paraphrase the text without marking it as such.
- **Diagram integrity.**  Diagrams should be reproduced faithfully in scale and geometry. If color or interactivity is unavailable, black-and-white or static reproduction is acceptable.
- **Identifiers over pagination.**  Sections, propositions, and diagrams are labeled so the text can be cited even when page numbers vary. Preserve these identifiers where possible.
## What does _not_ matter

- Exact trim size
- Paper stock (recycled is fine)
- Binding method
- Cover design
- Print resolution beyond legibility

Use what you have. Durability is good; perfection is unnecessary.
## Suggested baseline (not a requirement)

- Uncoated offset or book paper
- Black-and-white printing
- Perfect binding, saddle stitch, or sewn sections
- Partial or excerpted printings are acceptable
## Editions and differences

Different physical editions may coexist without hierarchy. A shop-floor pamphlet, a zine excerpt, and a library reference volume are all valid realizations of the same text, serving different circulation needs.

If you add a colophon or note, a simple line like the following is sufficient:

**Printed locally under CC / FAL terms from the publicly available source text.**
## Economics

Pay-what-you-can, cost-recovery pricing, barter, gifting, and free distribution are all consistent with the intent of this work. No royalties are expected or required for local or collective printings.
## Intent

This text is meant to move.  
It is meant to be handled, argued with, annotated, copied, and carried.  
If your shop, collective, or press can put it into circulation using the means you have, you are doing the right thing.
