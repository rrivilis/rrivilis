**Patronage, Engagement & Correspondence FAQ**  

This document describes how this work is funded, distributed, engaged with, and protected from misappropriation. It exists to preserve the conditions necessary for long-duration, independent work.

⸻

**What is the status of this work?**  

The content of this work is currently frozen for typographic finalization. This work is publicly available and released under a **dual license**:

• **Creative Commons Attribution–ShareAlike (CC BY-SA 4.0)**  

• **Free Art License (FAL 1.3)**  

It may be shared, modified, translated, and redistributed under the terms of those licenses. No permission is required.

Derivative works, interpretations, or applications do not represent this project unless explicitly stated. Forking is permitted; representation is not.

Applications of ideas derived from this work that result in harm, coercion, or domination do not constitute failures of interpretation, but failures of constraint adherence.  

The work is not paywalled. Support sustains time and continuity, not access.

⸻

**How is the work funded?**  

This work was independently researched and voluntarily produced in full without prior institutional funding or support, including content and typographic production. Moving forward as a public artifact, the project is supported through **voluntary individual patronage**.

Primary support channels:

• **Liberapay**  

• **GitHub Sponsors**  

These platforms are used to minimize political exclusion, geographic discrimination, and extractive payment infrastructure.
⸻

**Why not Stripe, PayPal, or similar platforms?**  

Payment platforms that freeze accounts, exclude populations, or act as informal instruments of geopolitical enforcement are not used.

This project does not participate in financial infrastructures that impose arbitrary exclusions or political coercion.

⸻

**What kinds of support are accepted?**  

Accepted:

• Individual patrons (recurring or one-time)

• Independent art grants **without** editorial control, branding requirements, or programmatic deliverables

All support is:

• Non-earmarked

• Non-governing

• Non-advisory

Patronage does **not** confer influence, access, or representation.

Independent art grants are evaluated case by case and must not require public attribution, branding, progress reporting, or institutional affiliation.  

⸻
**What kinds of funding are declined?**  

The project does **not** accept:

• Corporate sponsorships

• Military, defense, prison, intelligence, or security funding

• Law-enforcement or police-affiliated funding

• Government or NGO funding tied to policy objectives

• Foundation or institutional funding that imposes outcomes, reporting, or narrative control

• Funding intended for reputational laundering, prestige exchange, or governance participation
⸻

**Is this work affiliated with any institution?**  

No. The work is produced independently. Institutions may engage with it, but do not govern, steward, or represent it.
⸻

**How does the project engage with universities and higher education?**  

Academic engagement is welcomed strictly **under conditions of academic freedom without institutional filtration of content**.

Accepted:

• Faculty-initiated seminars, workshops, lectures, and teaching roles

• Departmental or scholarly invitations without prior content approval

• Contexts that allow open inquiry and disagreement

Declined:

• Student affairs administration-mediated events

• Public relations review or messaging control

• Institutional branding exercises

• Performative or reputational appearances

The work is not subject to administrative mediation.

**Methodological Note on Academic Correspondence**  

Communications received from academic or institutional contexts that rely on categorical dismissal (e.g., demands for peer review as a prerequisite for engagement or procedural objections unrelated to internal coherence or the content of the project) may be recorded in anonymized, aggregate form as qualitative data.

Such documentation, if undertaken, would serve sociological and epistemic analysis of disciplinary boundary maintenance, evaluative heuristics, and institutional response patterns to nonstandard research programs.

No individual names, affiliations, or identifying details will be published. This notice is informational only and does not imply response, rebuttal, or engagement.

⸻

**What about conferences?**  

Accepted:

• Standard talks

• Panels

• Workshops

• Working groups

Declined:

• Keynote addresses

• Featured, opening, or closing roles

• Appearances intended to confer symbolic legitimacy or prestige

Conference participation is horizontal, not ceremonial. I may not accept all requests, but I will consider them on a case by case basis.
⸻

**Do you participate in debates?**  

No. Engagements premised on adversarial debate, justificatory performance, or rhetorical contest are declined. The work is offered for study, discussion, and contradiction analysis—not for performative defense.

⸻

**What is the press and media policy?**  **Is press coverage allowed?**  

Yes. Journalists and writers are welcome to **write about the work**.

**What kinds of media engagement are accepted?**  

Selective participation may include:

• Long-form interviews

• Print or written journalism

• Serious editorial contexts with sufficient space and time

• Journalists with a demonstrated record of good-faith, critical reporting

**What kinds of media engagement are declined?**  

• Broadcast debates

• Rapid-cycle commentary

• Soundbite-driven or adversarial formats

• PR-managed appearances

• Requests requiring simplification, positioning, or real-time reaction

Press coverage does not imply endorsement or alignment.
⸻

**Are public statements issued in response to current events?**  

No. This project does not participate in real-time commentary, reactive positioning, or public statements in response to current events. Silence should not be interpreted as neutrality, indifference, or endorsement.

**The work itself constitutes the position.**  

⸻

**How can you be contacted?**  

A public contact email is provided for **formal inquiries only**, including:

• Academic invitations

• Art grant inquiries consistent with this policy

• Publishing, translation, or archival questions

• Serious press inquiries

⸻

**How often is email checked?**  

Email is reviewed **periodically**, typically on a **multi-month cadence**.

Responses, if any, may take time.

Lack of response should not be interpreted as refusal or disinterest.

⸻

**What kinds of messages are not answered?**  

Generally not answered:

• Requests for debate or justification

• Requests for private explanations of the work

• Unsolicited critique or commentary, or requests

• Media requests outside the press policy

• Requests for endorsement, affiliation, or platforming

Email is not a discussion channel.

⸻

**How does the project engage with artists, musicians, and designers?**  

Informal, peer-to-peer exchange with artists, musicians, designers, and cultural practitioners takes place **organically** and does not require formal mediation.

These engagements are horizontal and practice-based rather than institutional.

Engagements intended to operationalize harm, surveillance, coercion, or domination are declined regardless of funding source.  

⸻

**Does patronage imply endorsement or alignment?**  

No. Support does not imply ideological, political, or institutional alignment, nor does it grant representational authority.

⸻

**What is the guiding principle behind all of this?**  

Support is welcomed **where independence is preserved**.

Engagement is welcomed **where exchange is horizontal**.

Anything that requires capture, mediation, justification, or performance is declined.

**Appendix: Common Misclassifications I Will Not Correct**  

The following labels and objections have appeared frequently enough in responses to nonstandard research programs that I am listing them here to reduce redundant correspondence.

If any of the following apply, no response should be expected. You may be documented and studied for sociological field research purposes if you attempt this.

• **“This is mysticism / metaphysics / metaphor”**  

The work makes formal claims, introduces internal constraints, and advances testable structural arguments. Misclassification as mysticism indicates methodological projection rather than critique.

• **“This needs peer review before it can be taken seriously”**  

Peer review is a downstream institutional process, not a prerequisite for intelligibility or internal coherence. Requests framed this way do not constitute engagement with the work itself.

• **“Where are the proofs?”**  

The work is not a monograph in pure mathematics. Proof-theoretic obligations, where relevant, are local to specific formalisms and do not generalize across the entire project.

• **“This isn’t rigorous”**  

Claims of insufficient rigor without reference to specific definitions, constructions, or failure modes are throat clearing gestures rather than analytical feedback. Proposed updates to formalisms, disagreements, or recommendations on research trajectory are welcome and encouraged.

• **“This should be simplified / made accessible”**  

Difficulty is not an error state. The work is intentionally calibrated for readers willing to sustain complexity without compression.

• **“This belongs in [discipline X]”**  

The project operates upstream of disciplinary partitioning. The work states in the prologue that it is a first principles project. Attempts to reassign it wholesale to a single field misunderstand its scope.

• **“This is just philosophy” / “This is just theory” / “This is metaphysics”**  

These are indexical referents, not structure or content. The work spans formal systems, historical analysis, and applied models without reducing to any one of them.

• **“This is political / ideological”**  

The work analyzes material and institutional constraints. Discomfort with implications does not constitute ideological content, but may constitute ideological affiliation by the accuser.

• **“This needs to be debated”**  

The project is not advanced through adversarial debate formats. Critical engagement requires slow reading and specific contradiction analysis. I do not answer to requests that led with requirements for justification.

• **“This reminds me of [thinker X], therefore it is derivative”**  

Lineage recognition is not a refutation. Adjacency does not establish redundancy.

• **“This is not how research is normally done”**  

Correct. The work does not depend on conforming to existing procedural templates prior to stabilization.

• **“You should collaborate with an institution to legitimize this”**  

Institutional affiliation is not a criterion of validity and is not being sought.

• **“This is unfalsifiable / not even wrong”**  

The work introduces structural commitments that can fail or update. Failure mode testing and falsifiability are encouraged. Blanket claims of unfalsifiability without specifying failure conditions will not be addressed.

• **“This sounds like [buzzword]”**  

Analogical resemblance is not an argument.

**Closing note for appendix** 

This list is not exhaustive and will not be expanded.

Its purpose is not to pre-empt criticism or eschew answerability, but to clarify which forms of response do not register as engagement.

Silence in response to these classifications should be interpreted as a boundary, not as concession. Future iterations of this list may be derived empirically.  

**Final note of engagement policy**  

This work operates upstream of disciplines, institutions, platforms, and cycles of reaction. It is concerned with the grammars of coordination that make such systems possible, not with occupying them as a public persona. I operate strictly through custodianship of the work moving forward and am keeping patronage local without filtration through institutions. Implementation and future research moving forward refers to research tooling, conceptual infrastructure, pedagogical artifacts, and selective applied collaborations consistent with this policy. It does not imply policy advocacy, institutional rollout, or program deployment.  

The conditions outlined here exist so the work can continue without distortion. Custodianship is not permanent. The custodial duty for the project exists only so long as it is necessary for the work’s integrity and transport. I only care that it completes its passage for as long as it is useful.
